# Find That Film

[Find That Film](https://find-that-film.netlify.app/) is a React app that helps you when you can't remember the name of a film, but can remember who's in it.

This was my first project using the [React testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro), which was a steep learning curve but made the process much smoother.
